Overview:
	This is a simple library page for browsing, reserving, bookmarking and borrowing books.
	
	The web application is supposed to be able to handle regular users who are browsing
	books (and possibly items) and reserving, bookmarking or borrowing them.
	
	Another type of user (user plus) can manage the items in the system (CRUD) and is responsible
	for checking in and out items that users wish to borrow/return.
	
	There is an automated system in place that can notify users about the expiry of the 
	alloted time to borrow an item (for example).
	
Users/Roles:
	User:
		Allowed to browse, bookmark, reserve and borrow items in the library database (using
		the web page interface).

	User plus (librarian):
		Allowed to manage all the items checked into the library (database). Can check in and
		out books and items that the regular users wishes to borrow or return.
		All done through a section of the web interface.
